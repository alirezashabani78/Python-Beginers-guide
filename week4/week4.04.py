This program will ask you about your name and whatever you write it will print it out with the first letter as a
capital letter so ADAM =Adam OR AdAM always = Adam, the purpose with this program is to use s.lower() that make 
the letters small and s.capitalize() that wil make the first letter in the name capital, basically the name
will always start with a Capital latter.
